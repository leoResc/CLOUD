#CLOUD
CLOUD is a software & hardware project which basically consists of a lamp with many LEDs and an associated web application.
The web application is running on a Raspberry Pi allowing you to upload music, define playlists and create events. To each event, you can attach one or more playlists.
As soon as an event is activated, other people e.g. guests on your party can log-in to your CLOUD with their smartphone or their laptop.
They will be able to see the playlist of the current event, each contained song and they can vote for those songs, which they like most.
The song which gained the most votes will be played next by sound system built-in your CLOUD.
CLOUD itself has an integrated 2.1 sound system, an Arduino Uno for lightning up the LEDs and a Raspberry Pi 2 serving the web application.
